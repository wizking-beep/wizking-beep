# Brian Baraka
Electrical & Electronics Engineering Student
Focused on C++ and Engineering-Oriented Software Development

## About
I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at JKUAT with a growing focus on C++ and structured problem-solving.
My current priority is strengthening my understanding of:
- Programming logic and algorithmic thinking
- Memory management and data structures in C++
- Writing efficient, predictable code
- Applying software principles to engineering problems

While I have experience building web and mobile applications, my main direction now is deeper technical competence in systems-level programming and engineering-focused computation.

## Current Technical Focus
---
C++ (standard library, memory management, pointers/references, OOP fundamentals)
Engineering-Oriented Programming Interests
Data structures and algorithm implementation from scratch
Numerical methods and mathematical computation
Simulation of engineering systems
Efficient use of memory and processing resources
Structured debugging and performance analysis

## Previous Development Experience
---
**Frontend & Mobile**
- React.js
- React Native (Expo)

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express
- REST APIs
- MongoDB

**Language**
- JavaScript / TypeScript

## Current Work
---
Strengthening C++ fundamentals through structured problem-solving
Implementing core data structures manually
Studying computational methods applicable to electrical systems
Building small console-based engineering tools

## Approach
---
I prefer understanding how things work internally rather than relying only on high-level abstractions.
My engineering background shapes how I write software:
clear logic, predictable behavior, and attention to efficiency.
